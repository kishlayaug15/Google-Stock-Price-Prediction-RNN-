# Recurrent-Neural-Networks

Here, I have implemented LSTMs in RNN and some dropout regularizations to stable the memory through RNN. Here, I have basically gathered Google Stock Prices from past few years and showed comparison between real and predicted output trends which are similiar. Can be improved by adding more layers of LSTMs, providing more Google Stock Prices Data Values. Also, we can even add new indicators which are highly correlated to our datasets for our improving our model efficiency.
